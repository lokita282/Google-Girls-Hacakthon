## Our Vision:
Learning has no bar and the educational environment should always be upfront. Keeping this in mind, our vision is to spread digital literacy among senior citizens and make them technologically smart and sound. Senior citizens are always excited to learn new things, maybe after their retirement or in their free time and here we have come up with a solution to make this process easier. Our aim is to build an application that acts as a technical assistant to the elderly, educating them about the ever changing technology trends. Our application majorly focuses on providing them with technical assistance for their day to day tasks like booking a ride, ordering food and medicines and by familiarizing them with general technical knowledge which includes the basic settings of oneâ€™s device like bluetooth, airplane mode etc. We want to create an application that is highly interactive, simple and user friendly and hence we have included multilingual voice assistants at all stages.
